    First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
     waterfalls, but within <br>its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys,
    meadows, ancient <br>giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

    Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. 
    We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. 
    This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite.

      We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. 
      You can pay the <span class= "bold">park entrance fee</span> upon arrival 
      (there's no need to pay it in advance).
